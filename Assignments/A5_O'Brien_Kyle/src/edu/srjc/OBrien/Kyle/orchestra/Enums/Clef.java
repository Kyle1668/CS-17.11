// Assignment 5 - Orchestra

// File Description: This program implements an orchestra system using abstract classes,
// enumeration types, and inheritance. All instruments inherit from a parent Instrument
// class. From there, instruments are split into winds and strings. Winds is further
// segregated into continuing categories until each instrument is fully categorized.

// Once all the instruments have been added, the orchestra is iterated through,
// and information about each instrument is printed to the console.
// This included common keys, pitches. For string instruments,
// the number of strings is printed. For wind instruments,
// whether they transpose from C is shown along with
// other instrument specific information.
